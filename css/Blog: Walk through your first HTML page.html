  <p style="color: blue; font-size: 30px;">HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it’s the “code” behind every webpage – even this one. If
    you’re just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it’s a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can’t do
    anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames – but it is handy as it helps you structure
    the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.</p>

  <h2>Step One - TAGS</h2>
  <img src="./Screenshot 2022-03-29 at 10.13.09 AM.png" alt="show nothing" height="=200" width="200">
  <p>Tags are what you’ll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to
    any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.

    Let’s look at two types of tags:

    <tag-example-1>I need a closign tag<tag-example-1>
        <tag-example-2 />I don't need a cloding tag.

        In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag and the
        second one is called the closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
        commonly used examples of such tags are <html>,

        <head>,

        <body>, <strong>, etc.

  <h2>Step Two – HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your document</h2>

  <p>These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML code.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>lalalala</em>

      <BODY> </BODY> is placed below your

      <HEAD> tag, and everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag. Text, images, links,
        and pretty much anything you can see in your browser live inside this tag.
    </li>
    <li>
      <HTML>

      </HTML> wraps your entire code. Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these tags.
    </li>
    <li>

      <HEAD> </HEAD> includes things like title, styles, and scripts. Head is usually present at the top (hah!), just
      inside the

</HTML> tag.</li>
</ul>
